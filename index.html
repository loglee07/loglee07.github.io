        <h2>Blog Post 1</h2>
        <p>My first blog post will serve as an introduction to the class community. I’ll share who I am, my year, major, and future goals, along with my experiences as a reader and writer both inside and outside of school. I’ll reflect on formative literacy experiences, how I see myself as a reader/writer now, and what I hope to learn (or unlearn) in this course. I’ll also talk about my hobbies and fandoms, how reading and writing fit into them, and the ways I interact with others around those interests. To make the post engaging and multimodal, I’ll include hyperlinks to texts I reference and images that connect to my ideas.</p>

        <h2>Blog Post 2</h2>
        <p>My blog topic will be sports betting, specifically using PrizePicks, which I got interested in through my love of sports and analyzing player stats. The community is mainly online, where users share strategies, tips, and experiences. I enjoy the mix of competition, strategy, and excitement, and through this blog I hope to explore how people interact and engage with PrizePicks and the broader sports betting culture.</p>
