      <h1>Blog Post #8: Starting Synthesis</h1>

      <p>Every community has its own way of speaking, but that of DFS takes it to a whole new level. Fast, casual, and inside are words that might describe the language of this world's people, who use it not only to show skill but also to fit in. I have noticed, from my time on <a href="https://www.prizepicks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PrizePicks</a> Discord servers and through posts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit</a>, that language is actually the key to fitting in. But it's this same language that makes joining in or feeling comfortable hard for any beginner.</p>

      <h2>My Observations from DFS Spaces</h2>

      <p>In online chats for DFS apps, like PrizePicks and on Reddit groups like r/sportsbook</p>

      <p>People talk to each other in shorthand: “1u” equals one betting unit; “chalk” is the favorite pick; and the term “sweat free” describes an easy win. Using this slang speaks to inside knowledge. When I first joined these groups, I saw new users who didn’t use similar terms were ignored or corrected. Over time, people start copying the same tone and language to fit in.</p>

      <p>In my primary research mostly observing PrizePicks chats I also saw a clear pattern to how people write. Posts are short, often all lowercase, and full of emojis or inside jokes. The writing style is more about a feeling of community than grammar or being clear. If you post something that sounds too serious or not confident, you stand out right away.</p>

      <h2>What the Research Says</h2>

      <p>According to the language expert James Gee, groups create “identity kits” with language that teach people how to act and sound to fit in. That means the DFS slang I see isn't just everyday talk; it is part of the way people show they are on the inside. The way its people talk acts as a sign of who they are. See Gee’s classic piece in the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/42743864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journal of Education</a>.</p>

      <p>Another article from <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/nms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Media &amp; Society</a> by Tanja Aitamurto explains how common language is used in online groups in general in order to build trust, especially in communities related to money or risk. In her study on digital gambling platforms, Aitamurto writes that people rely on familiar patterns of talk to prove trust and skill. That matches what I have seen in DFS chats: if you use the same slang and tone as others, your advice is more likely to be trusted.</p>

      <p>Both Gee and Aitamurto say that language builds belonging, but it also draws a line between insiders and outsiders.</p>

      <h2>Connecting My Findings and the Research</h2>

      <p>From what I have seen and read, communication in DFS communities does more than just share information; it decides who gets listened to. Experienced people who use slang, post screenshots, and speak with confidence are treated as pros. New players who write full sentences or ask beginner questions are sometimes ignored or teased.</p>

      <p>This way of talking helps the community feel close and active, but there is a downside. The focus on short, slang filled talk makes it harder to learn for those who are not used to DFS culture. In such a way, language strengthens the hidden pecking order within the community: attention goes to those who already know the terms, and newcomers should keep up with it or just stay quiet.</p>

      <p>This pattern connects to Gee's idea of learning by doing in groups you learn by imitating others until you sound like them. In DFS, the same thing happens: you learn the slang, short forms, and tone to fit in. But there is little room for questions or shows of confusion, unlike in a classroom.</p>

        <figcaption>Apps like PrizePicks use fast visual design and short text that fits the quick style of communication for the community.</figcaption>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>

      <p>These are unspoken rules of communication that decide who feels comfortable in the DFS space: people who already understand betting terms or have experience with fantasy sports fit right in. Others may feel left out, or even embarrassed, to post. The DFS community values speed, confidence, and humor and if you do not fit that style, your voice might not be heard. In all, my research and outside sources show that DFS language both builds community and serves as a barrier. It is a reminder that to talk means more than just words: it is power, who you are, and fitting in.</p>
