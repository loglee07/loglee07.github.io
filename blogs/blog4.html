      <h1>Blog Post #4: My Discourse Communities</h1>

      <p>We all belong to various groups in life, and these groups all have their own rules, way of talking, and ways of being interested in things. In class, we simply call them “discourse communities.” A discourse community is really a group of individuals who share the same interests, who talk in their own ways, and who initiate newcomers into the community. In this blog, I am going to present three discourse communities that I belong to: the sports betting discourse community, the investing discourse community, and my computer science classes.</p>

      <!-- SPORTS BETTING -->
      <h2>Sports Betting Community</h2>
      <p>One of the major discourse communities I belong to is online sports betting. This has a direct correlation to my blog topic since I engage on apps like
        <a href="https://www.prizepicks.com/" target="_blank">PrizePicks</a> and communities like
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/" target="_blank">r/sportsbook</a> on Reddit.</p>

      <div class="side-image-section">
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Members share their picks and communicate in short betting jargon.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div>
          <p><strong>Who are they and why?</strong> They are generally young adults or college students who are sports enthusiasts. They are members because they believe games are more enjoyable with wagering and they enjoy comparing selections with others.</p>
          <p><strong>What do they care about?</strong> The community cares about information, strategy, and being “sharp,” or making knowledgeable selections instead of depending on luck. They also appreciate the entertainment of celebrating victories and even coping together about “unlucky hooks.”</p>
          <p><strong>How do they communicate?</strong> People communicate using gambling lingo like “1u” (one unit of your bankroll) or “sweat free” (an easy-looking win). Communication occurs on Discord, Twitter, or Reddit through short messages, memes, and screenshots of betting slips. New members pick up the language by reading and then mimicking how others communicate.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- INVESTING -->
      <h2>Investing Community</h2>
      <p>One other group that I am a part of is the investor group. I follow forums like
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/" target="_blank">r/FinancialPlanning</a>
        and YouTube channels that lecture on stocks and personal finance.</p>

      <div class="side-image-section">
        <div>
          <p><strong>Who’s in it and why?</strong> The people in this group are a varied bunch: students, young professionals, and older people who want to grow their wealth or plan for retirement. I know this because posts and comments in forums usually entail people declaring their age and goals.</p>
          <p><strong>What do they care about?</strong> They are concerned with smart financial choices, patience, and learning. Long-term thinking is what the majority of people stick to, even in the face of rising and falling markets.</p>
          <p><strong>How do they talk?</strong> They speak in the language of “index funds,” “dividends,” or “compound interest.” New members usually pick up the lingo by reading posts, asking questions, and seeing tips from more experienced members.</p>

          <figcaption>Investing communities value long-term growth and financial discipline.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <!-- COMP SCI -->
      <h2>Computer Science Classes</h2>
      <p>The last community I am a part of is my computer science classes at SDSU. We also use online help when needed, including forums like
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>.
      </p>

      <div class="side-image-section">
        <figure>
          <img src="../images/coding-laptop.jpg" alt="Laptop with code on screen" class="side-image">
          <figcaption>Computer science students learn technical jargon together.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div>
          <p><strong>Who’s in it and why?</strong> Students, professors, and teaching assistants are all a part of it. We are all there to learn coding, problem solving, and preparing for future careers in technology.</p>
          <p><strong>What do we value?</strong> We value knowledge, teamwork, and hard work. Students will often help each other on homework and projects, and professors will teach us in large topics.</p>
          <p><strong>How do we talk to each other?</strong> The lingo includes technical terms like “algorithm,” “compiler,” or “data structures.” We talk in class, group projects, and online on sites like Stack Overflow. New students usually learn the lingo by going to class, reading code, and asking questions.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>What I’ve Learned from My Communities</h2>
      <p>These three discourse communities are all separate, but they also have a lot in common. They all are made up of members who share common goals, special terminology and jargon, and ways of bringing in new members. Sports betting communities are educating me in how to manage risk and excitement, investing is educating me in patience and financial responsibility, and computer science classes are giving me problem-solving skills for my eventual career.</p>
      <p>Being a member of these groups tells me that no matter what kind of group it is, you have to learn the language and the values if you are going to truly belong.</p>
