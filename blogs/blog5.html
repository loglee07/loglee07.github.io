      <h1>Blog Post #5: Discourse Community Proposal — Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS)</h1>

      <p>The discourse community I am going to be talking about for the rest of the semester is the Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) discourse community, or those who use apps like <a href="https://www.prizepicks.com/" target="_blank">PrizePicks</a> and FanDuel. The group of individuals here can be considered a discourse community due to the fact that they share common purposes, vocab, forums of communication, as well as common knowledge. Their purpose is to predict player performances and wager for risk and strategy in terms of money. The community will use slang such as "1u" for a unit of betting, "sweat free" for easy wins, or "chalk" for losing picks. These popular terms and phrases are the building blocks for the way the group communicates with each other.</p>

      <h2>Documents and Communication Spaces</h2>

      <p>There are a number of platforms and documents where this community engages and creates original material. Reddit is one important environment in which subreddits such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/" target="_blank">r/sportsbook</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrizePicks/" target="_blank">r/PrizePicks</a> allow users to submit lineups, share tips, and offer comments on games in live time. Discord servers are also common, these include channels for sharing strategy, picks, and results. The community produces original content such as betting slips, spreadsheets, screenshots, guides, and memes, all of which are used to express success and frustration.</p>

      <p>One of the important external documents referencing this group is an <a href="https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/14715920/dfs-backlash-why-daily-fantasy-sports-industry-under-siege" target="_blank">ESPN article</a> on the criticism of DFS. It describes how the industry grew rapidly with emphasis on promotion and scandals, framing how the non-industry players perceive fantasy sports. After reading that article, I was able to understand how public opinion of DFS affects my community's discussion.</p>

        <figcaption>Applications such as PrizePicks give users real-time feedback, which is an experience shared by all as far as analysis is concerned.</figcaption>

      <h2>What I Want to Understand</h2>

      <p>As I move further to study this discourse community, I would like to learn about the way language builds belonging. DFS users use vocabulary, statistics, and both hope and frustration that outsiders often do not understand. I would also like to learn how the community deals with responsible gambling, how members encourage or caution each other about betting limits and risk. Another aspect I want to explore is how public opinion influences self-identity. Do community members identify as gamblers, gamers, or analysts?</p>

      <p>Through exploring these questions, I can see how language, community values, and technology intersect to create the world of DFS. I want to show that this community is not just about picking games or making money. It is about communication, connection, and a shared love of competition.</p>
